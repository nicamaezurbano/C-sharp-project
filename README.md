**Problem Description:**

Alberto and Penny have just launched their Mr. Frostie on the tropical island of Calypso. It is an ocean front milkshake shop that will be a relaxing way to spend the summer. Boats loaded with lots of customers came to Calypso Island in search of the best freezer treats around. Alberto and Penny couldnâ€™t handle the manual work of getting and serving the orders so they decided to have an application that will manage the customer's order, keep track of the number of milkshakes sold, the number of customers and the total sales each day.

Design a c# windows form application that accepts the order of the customers. One customer can order milkshakes more than one allowing them to view the subtotal and the total of their order/s. Alberto & Penny would like to customize the background color, the font color and the font style to resemble an event or holiday in the island. After each day, they also want to view the number of milkshakes sold, the number of customers and the total sales per day.
